This example demonstrates the construction of a parallel scientific application
using Pyton with F90 and C/C++ with MPI using shared objects. 
To compile this code:
% source /home/sshende/apps/tau.cshrc (or bashrc)

To build this example, we need a working pyMPI. It was not found on CX1. TAU needs to be built with MPI and -pythoninc=<dir> configuration option. This specifies the location of the Python.h header directory.
% make
this should build _samint.so
% cd example
and see the README file in the example directory on how to run the code with 
and without TAU. 

To build this with TAU instrumentation at C,C++, F90 level as well, you may 
set:

% setenv TAU_MAKEFILE $TAU/Makefile.tau-icpc-mpi-python-pdt

% make clean
% make F90=tau_f90.sh CC=tau_cc.sh CXX=tau_cxx.sh
