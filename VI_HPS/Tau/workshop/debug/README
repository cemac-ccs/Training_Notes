You may use TAU to identify the location of a program crash. 

First compile and run without TAU:
% make
% salloc -N 1 --time=45
% mpirun -np 4 ./foo
% mpirun -np 4 

see the output. 

This uses runtime preloading of the TAU library to instrument the application.
You may also uncomment #CC= ...tau_cc.sh in the Makefile (and comment CC=mpicc -g) to use TAU to compile the code and then you may use the normal mpirun command to run the instrumented code to generate the backtrace. 

% export TAU_TRACK_SIGNALS=1
% mpirun -np 4 ./foo
% paraprof

to view the results in either case.
