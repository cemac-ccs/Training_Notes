To use TAU with Sweep3d modify the Makefile and uncomment the following 
lines to use tau_f90.sh and tau_cc.sh as the names of the compilers.
FC = mpif90
#FC = tau_f90.sh

CC=mpif90
#CC = tau_cc.sh

Next, set an environment variable:
% setenv TAU_MAKEFILE $TAULIBDIR/Makefile.tau-mpi-pdt-pgi

% make
% qsub -I -V; mpirun -np 6 ./sweep3d.mpi
% paraprof

Generates profiles.  To generate traces, use:

% setenv TAU_MAKEFILE  $TAULIBDIR/Makefile.tau-mpi-pdt-pgi


to choose a stub makefile with PAPI counter support. 
% rm  sweep3d.mpi
% make

Select counters:
% setenv TAU_METRICS TIME:PAPI_FP_INS:PAPI_L1_DCM

Then, run the program:
% mpirun -np 6 ./sweep3d.mpi

It creates traces and event definition files (.trc, .edf) that should be merged. 
% tau_treemerge.pl
This creates a single tau.trc and tau.edf file.  Convert it to the Vampir format:
% tau2otf tau.trc tau.edf sweep.otf
% vampir sweep.otf

Select Global Displays -> Timeline. Then, zoom in to a segment of a timeline. Choose 
Global Displays -> Counter timeline. Right click and select another counter such as 
Counter -> TAU Counter Data-> PAPI_TOT_CYC.
Select a single process in the global timeline by clicking on it and then choose
Process Displays -> Calltree to see its calltree. 
Also, Preferences -> Color styles -> Activities will help you choose a different
color for a function.
