In this example, we illustrate how to instrument a Fortran and C code with TAU.
Please edit the config/make.def file and config/suite.def file to choose the
name of the compilers (F90 = tau_f90.sh, CC = tau_cc.sh) and the problem size
respectively. The suite.def file contains a list of applications to be built
and the problem size (S, W, A, B, C...) and the number of CPUs to use. For 
instance, lu.W.4 stands for W problem built for 4 cpus. 

We should use a TAU stub makefile with -mpi and -pdt in its name. To try
the simplest, use
% export TAU_MAKEFILE=$TAU/Makefile.tau-icpc-papi-mpi-pdt

% make clean
% make
% cd bin
% bsub -I ...
% cd <NPB3.1/bin>
% mpirun -np 4 ./lu.W.4
% pprof
% paraprof


To use hardware performance counters from PAPI:
% export TAU_METRICS TIME:PAPI_FP_INS:PAPI_L1_DCM
NOTE: It is important to delete previous performnace data
% rm -f profile*
% mpirun -np 4 ./lu.W.4
% paraprof & 

To use communication matrix display:
% export TAU_COMM_MATRIX=1
% mpirun -np 4 ./lu.W.4
% paraprof &
